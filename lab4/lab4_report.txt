Exercise

3.1	
Lab4.c print_message() generates a random number and modulo it with 5 to get a number between 0-4.
It then prints out the message on N index in message[].

3.2
The issue is that malloc is not able to allocate the memory needed from the system, resulting in it returning null.
Reducing malloc(1<<31) to (1<30) fixes the problem and the program will get the required memory.
This could also be reduced further.

3.3
Why does the program not work properly?
- The issue seems to be with how getline() stores the input in memory, which is why
we have to use a pointer to our string[] so that we can access the value.

Fixes:
- "You entered the %d character line: %s", n". Changed "n" to "n-1" to offset getline() returning delimiter character.
- Changed for loops from "i<=length" to "i<length" to make 10 random characters, not 11.
- Changed rand_array to [9].
- Changed string to string[32] and *str.
- Changed "j" to 32 to get correct buffer-size.

Note: Could have used a condition check for memory, but didn't seem to be too important in the task.
